As a new product manager joining a team, creating a structured onboarding plan for your first 90 days is crucial for setting yourself up for success. This plan serves as a roadmap, aligning expectations with your manager and team while ensuring you tackle the right priorities during this pivotal transition period.

## The Importance of a 30-60-90 Day Plan

A well-crafted 30-60-90 day plan offers several benefits:

1. **Aligns Expectations**: By discussing and documenting your plan with your manager, you ensure that both parties are on the same page regarding deliverables, timelines, and priorities.

2. **Provides Structure**: The plan establishes a clear framework for your onboarding, helping you stay focused and productive during the initial months when there is a steep learning curve.

3. **Facilitates Learning**: The plan should emphasize learning about the company, product, customers, and team dynamics, enabling you to make informed decisions and build credibility.

4. **Identifies Quick Wins**: Incorporating achievable goals and quick wins into the plan allows you to demonstrate your value and capabilities early on, building momentum and confidence within the team.

## The 30-60-90 Day Plan Breakdown

Let's delve into the key components of an effective 30-60-90 day plan for a new product manager:

### First 30 Days

The first 30 days should be primarily dedicated to learning and relationship-building:

* **Company Onboarding**: Complete HR paperwork, training, and familiarize yourself with company policies and processes.

* **Learn the Product and Team**: Understand the team's current plans, needs, and processes. Shadow experienced team members, attend relevant meetings, and use the product extensively.

* **Meet Stakeholders**: Schedule introductory meetings with key stakeholders, including your immediate team, cross-functional partners, executives, and customers.

* **Deliverable Example**: Complete a "Starter Project" by week 3, such as launching an A/B test or implementing a small feature, to gain hands-on experience with the team's workflows.

### First 60 Days

As you gain more context and credibility, gradually take on more responsibilities:

* **Lead Execution**: Take over as the primary product manager, with reverse shadowing from the previous PM or an experienced team member.

* **Continue Learning**: Attend customer meetings, review support tickets, and immerse yourself in the product and market landscape.

* **Deliverable Example**: Run execution for a major launch or create a quarterly roadmap for the team by the end of this period.

### First 90 Days

By the end of the third month, you should be operating independently and demonstrating your impact:

* **Independent Leadership**: Lead the team without reverse shadowing, making informed decisions and driving initiatives.

* **Continuous Learning**: Maintain a consistent pulse on customer needs, market trends, and areas for product improvement.

* **Deliverable Example**: Achieve team OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) or launch a significant product update.

## Tips for Crafting an Effective Plan

To create a tailored and impactful 30-60-90 day plan, consider the following tips:

1. **Collaborate with Your Manager**: Involve your manager in the planning process, seeking their input and guidance on expectations, priorities, and potential quick wins.

2. **Prioritize Learning**: Emphasize learning activities, such as shadowing team members, attending customer meetings, and reviewing product documentation.

3. **Identify Knowledge Gaps**: Assess your current knowledge and experience, and plan activities to fill any gaps related to the product, industry, or company-specific processes.

4. **Incorporate Feedback Loops**: Schedule regular check-ins with your manager, team, and stakeholders to gather feedback and adjust your plan as needed.

5. **Be Realistic**: Set achievable goals and account for the time required for learning, building relationships, and navigating new processes.

6. **Remain Flexible**: Be prepared to adapt your plan as you uncover new information or face unexpected challenges during the onboarding process.

By crafting a comprehensive and tailored 30-60-90 day plan, you can navigate the critical first few months as a new product manager with confidence and clarity. This structured approach will help you build strong relationships, gain valuable insights, and start delivering impact for your team and organization.
